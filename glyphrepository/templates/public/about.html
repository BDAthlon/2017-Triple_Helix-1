      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Over the past 20 years, the visual representation of genetic sequence features, parts, and constructs has evolved considerably, from simple colored blocks to a variety of glyphs capturing diï¬€erent sequence functions. During this time, organizations such as the <a href="http://sbolstandard.org/download/sbol-visual-1-0-0-specification/"> Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)</a> Developers Group have made considerable progress in cataloguing commonly used synthetic biology glyphs and establishing standard procedures for curating new ones. Furthermore, <a href="https://github.com/VoigtLab/dnaplotlib"> DNAplotlib</a> is a library that enables highly customizable visualization of individual genetic constructs and libraries of design variants.  What the greater synthetic biology community still lacks, however, is a common online resource for aggregating and distributing data for genetic design visualization.</p>
