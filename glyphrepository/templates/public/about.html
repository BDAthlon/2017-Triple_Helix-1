      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Over the past 20 years, the visual representation of genetic sequence features, parts, and constructs has evolved considerably, from simple colored blocks to a variety of glyphs capturing diï¬€erent sequence functions. During this time, organizations such as the <a href="http://sbolstandard.org/download/sbol-visual-1-0-0-specification/"> Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)</a> Developers Group have made considerable progress in cataloguing commonly used synthetic biology glyphs and establishing standard procedures for curating new ones. What the greater synthetic biology community still lacks, however, is a common online resource for aggregating and distributing data for genetic design visualization.</p>

      <p>The SynBio Glyphs Repository was created to be as such a resource by James Scott-Brown, Iulia Gherman and Margarita Kopniczky at 2017 BDAthlon, IWBDA, Pittsburgh.</p>
